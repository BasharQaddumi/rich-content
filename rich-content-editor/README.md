# wix-draft-js-text-editor
This is the beginning of the new wix text editor.
The text editor is based on draft-js and the draft-js-plugins projects
Adaptations were made to fit wix environment with the styling and plugins that works well with wix platforms
The plugin model simplifies the creation of plugins and hides the complexity of the text editor from the plugins
